The program was working when I checked it. You will probably notice that there is some extra code for things like being able to select how many Words I could remove at a time.
I ran out of time and so wasn't able to implement everything I wanted to into the program.

I wrote all of the classes, but I did use Chat gpt to check them to make sure they were correct in syntax. I also use chat GPT to explain some concepts to me and it provided some ways to do things more effectively.
An example of this is in the program that removes three words. I was kind of stuck on that 1 and so it showed me how I could do it and how I could handle situations like when there were only three words left and I 
was struggling to get it to break the loop.
