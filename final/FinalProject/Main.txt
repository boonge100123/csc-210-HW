This is a program that has three main capabilities. 

The first capability is it will allow you to create a personal library of books. The intention of it was it would be a way to keep 
track of your books, keep track of how muchthe cost of your entire library is, and keep track of the amounts of books that you have. 

The second capability of this program is it will let you sit goals for how much you want to read or listen to a book. When entering 
this part of it, it's going to first ask you what type of goal you want, whether you want it to be a daily goal, a weekly goal, a 
monthly goal or a yearly goal. It's then going to ask you whether you want to keep track of the goal in pages, chapters or books
This will allow the user to create a goal that for example, a daily goal where I want to read 100 pages today. Another example Might 
be I want to read ten books this year

The third functionality is A wish list managerThis works almost identically to the personal library manager.but instead of books that 
you own, you can put books that you would like to own and their cost. It also lets you transfer books straight from the wish list to 
your library if they are purchased. 



The program works With Json files and because of this it made it so a lot of my abstractions had to be set to public because json files 
can only interact with public varibles. I did use private and protected varibles As often as I could in accordance to the rubric.
